                    <p>Spondylosis, also known as spinal osteoarthritis, is a common degenerative condition that affects the spine. It occurs due to the gradual wear and tear of the spinal discs and the facet joints, which are the small joints in the back of the spine. As we age, the discs lose their water content and elasticity, becoming thinner and less able to cushion the vertebrae. Additionally, the facet joints can develop osteoarthritis, leading to inflammation and stiffness.</p> 
                    <p>Here are some key points to consider when discussing spondylosis:</p>
                    <p><b>Symptoms:</b>Spondylosis often manifests with symptoms such as stiffness and pain in the neck or lower back. This pain may radiate to other areas such as the shoulders or buttocks. Some individuals may also experience numbness, tingling, or weakness in the arms or legs, particularly if there is compression of nerves in the spine.</p>       
                    <p><b>Causes:</b>While aging is the primary factor contributing to spondylosis, other factors can increase the risk or accelerate its development. These include genetic predisposition, repeated stress or strain on the spine due to certain occupations or activities, obesity, and injury or trauma to the spine.</p> 
                    <p><b>Diagnosis:</b>Diagnosis of spondylosis typically involves a thorough medical history, physical examination, and imaging studies such as X-rays, MRI, or CT scans. These tests help evaluate the extent of degeneration in the spine and identify any nerve compression or other complications.</p>
                    <p><b>Treatment:</b>Treatment for spondylosis aims to alleviate pain, improve function, and prevent further deterioration of the spine. Conservative treatments may include medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy, exercises to strengthen the muscles supporting the spine, and lifestyle modifications such as weight management and ergonomic adjustments. In more severe cases or if conservative measures fail to provide relief, interventions such as epidural steroid injections or surgery may be considered to decompress nerves or stabilize the spine.</p> 
                    <p><b>Prevention:</b>While spondylosis is a natural part of aging, certain measures can help reduce its impact or delay its onset. These include maintaining a healthy weight, adopting good posture and body mechanics, staying active with regular exercise to strengthen the core muscles, avoiding smoking, and using proper ergonomics at work and during daily activities to minimize strain on the spine.</p>     
                    <p>It's essential for individuals experiencing symptoms of spondylosis to seek medical evaluation and personalized treatment recommendations from healthcare professionals, as early intervention can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>
