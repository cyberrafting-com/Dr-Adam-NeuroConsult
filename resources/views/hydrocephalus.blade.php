                    <p>Hydrocephalus is a condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the cavities (ventricles) of the brain. This buildup of fluid can result in increased pressure on the brain, potentially causing damage to brain tissue. Hydrocephalus can occur at any age, from infancy to adulthood, and can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired later in life due to injury or illness.</p>
                    <h2>Causes:</h2>  
                    <p><b>Congenital Factors:</b>Hydrocephalus may result from abnormal development of the brain and spinal cord during fetal growth. This could be due to genetic factors or certain environmental influences.</p>       
                    <p><b>Acquired Conditions:</b>Hydrocephalus can also develop as a result of conditions such as meningitis, brain tumors, head trauma, intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain's ventricles), or complications from surgery.</p>   
                    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
                    <p><b>Infants:</b>Enlargement of the head, bulging fontanelles (soft spots), rapid increase in head circumference, vomiting, irritability, poor feeding, seizures, downward deviation of the eyes (sunsetting sign), and developmental delays.</p>   
                    <p><b>Older Children and Adults:</b>Headache, nausea, vomiting, blurred or double vision, difficulty with balance and coordination, cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, and changes in personality or behavior.</p> 
                    <h2>Diagnosis:</h2>
                    <p><b>Physical Examination:</b>A doctor may observe signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as a bulging fontanelle in infants or abnormalities in eye movement in older individuals.</p>
                    <p><b>Imaging Studies:</b>CT scans or MRI scans are commonly used to visualize the brain's ventricles and assess the extent of fluid accumulation.</p> 
                    <p><b>Intracranial Pressure Monitoring:</b>In some cases, a device may be placed within the skull to measure pressure levels within the brain.</p>      
                    <h2>Treatment:</h2>
                    <p><b>Surgical Intervention:</b>The primary treatment for hydrocephalus often involves the placement of a shunt system. This device diverts excess CSF away from the brain to another part of the body, such as the abdominal cavity, where it can be absorbed.</p>   
                    <p><b>Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV):</b>In select cases, particularly in infants with certain types of hydrocephalus, an ETV procedure may be performed. This involves creating a small opening in the floor of the third ventricle to allow CSF to flow out of the brain.</p> 
                    <p><b>Monitoring and Supportive Care:</b>Regular monitoring by healthcare professionals is essential to assess the effectiveness of treatment and manage any complications that may arise. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other supportive measures may also be beneficial, especially for individuals with developmental delays or disabilities.</p>
                    <p>Hydrocephalus is a complex condition that requires comprehensive evaluation and management by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including neurosurgeons, neurologists, pediatricians, and rehabilitation specialists. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical for optimizing outcomes and minimizing the risk of long-term complications.</p>
